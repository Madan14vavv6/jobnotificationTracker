## Philosophy

- **Calm**: Favor soft neutrals, controlled accent usage, and generous whitespace. Avoid visual noise.
- **Intentional**: Every element exists to support decision-making around job notifications; no decorative UI.
- **Coherent**: Layouts, spacing, and typography follow a single, predictable system.
- **Confident**: Clear type hierarchy and consistent interaction states, without playful or experimental visuals.

## Constraints

- No gradients, no glassmorphism, no neon colors.
- No hackathon-style components or heavy animations.
- Motion is limited to short, functional transitions for color and borders.

## Layout structure

- **Top bar**: Anchors the product identity and entry point to account-level actions.
- **Content header**: Communicates where the user is and what they can do on this screen.
- **Primary workspace**: The main surface for reviewing and acting on job notifications.
- **Secondary panel**: Contextual space for filters, summaries, or secondary insights.
- **Proof footer**: A stable area for proof-of-value statements and system status.
