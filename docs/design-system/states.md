## Error, empty, and loading states

- **Error**
  - Use danger tokens exclusively for error contexts.
  - Prefer concise inline messages close to the source of the problem.
  - For page-level issues, use a banner that does not block the primary workspace.

- **Empty**
  - Communicate clearly that the absence of data is expected at first.
  - Provide one clear next step; avoid competing actions.
  - Layout should mirror the eventual data view to reduce cognitive shift when data appears.

- **Loading**
  - Reserve skeletons for layouts where structure is known.
  - Use similar shapes and spacing as the final content.
  - Never introduce additional colors or decoration in loading states.
